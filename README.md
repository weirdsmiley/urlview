Extract URLs from a text file and allow the user to select via a menu

### NOTE
This is a forked repository from Michael Elkins' ([sigpipe](https://github.com/sigpipe/)) `urlview` tool. This contains a patch fixing an error produced by backspacing while in search-mode. More details are in the [commit history](https://github.com/weirdsmiley/urlview/commit/78a8e13c10a8b21c564f72241fbfa7a98532e558).

I tried to contact a maintainer from Arch User Repository (AUR) but got no reply. And I had no contacts of Michael either. So I put up this patched repository for everyone.
